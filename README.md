# dofus-cooldown-tracks0r

A tool to track Spell-Cooldowns and Spell-Variants of your opponents so you don't have to remember all x).

## How to use:

First of all select 3 classes.  
Then there are two modes to interact with Spells.

-   Mode 1: Select Variants:  
    In this mode you can click on spells to mark them in color.  
    This will help you to remember which variants your opponents have chosen.
-   Mode 2: Track Cooldown:  
    In this mode you can click on spells to add them to the Cooldown-Timeline.

    > Click on a turn in the Timeline first to select it! :)

    In the Cooldown Timeline you can see in which round your opponents used which spell.  
    You can also see how long the spell is still on cooldown.
